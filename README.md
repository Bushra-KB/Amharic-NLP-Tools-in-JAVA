## Amharic NLP Tools in Java

This repository contains implementations of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and tools specifically for the Amharic language using Java. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of tools to facilitate NLP research and development for Amharic.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words, sentences, or other meaningful units.
- **Sentence Segmentation**: Dividing text into individual sentences.
- **Sentence Boundary Detection**: Identifying the boundaries of sentences within a text.
- **Normalization**:
  - Character normalization
  - Abbreviation substitution
  - Strange character, word, and symbol removal
  - Removal of emojis
  - Removal of emoticons
  - Removal of punctuations
  - Conversion of emoticons to words
  - Conversion of emojis to words
- **StopWord Removal**: Removing common words that do not carry significant meaning.
- **Noun Phrase Chunking**: Identifying and grouping noun phrases.
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root form.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form by removing suffixes.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning parts of speech to each word in a sentence.
- **Word-Sense Disambiguation**: Determining the correct meaning of a word based on context.
- **Co-reference Resolution**: Identifying when different expressions refer to the same entity.
- **Entity Linking**: Connecting entities mentioned in the text to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base.
- **Terminology Extraction**: Extracting domain-specific terms from text.
- **Discourse Parsing**: Analyzing the structure of discourse in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text.
- **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined categories.
- **Language Modeling**: Building models to predict the next word in a sequence.
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from Amharic to other languages and vice versa.
